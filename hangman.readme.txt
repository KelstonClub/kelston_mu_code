We want a game of hangman where the computer selects a word of a chosen
length (to offer the user a "difficulty" rating) and then the user tries
to guess the word in the usual way:

* User chooses a letter
* If the letter matches one (or more) in the word, those letters are filled in
* If the letter doesn't match one in the word, a section of the scaffold/hangman is drawn
* If the word is complete, the user wins
* If the hangman is complete the computer wins

We've split into three modules partly so it can be implemented by three
people / teams, but also to emphasise the notion of decoupling -- one module
doesn't know what the other modules are doing. Only the controller "hangman"
module passes things around.

Also, although the intention is to have the drawing module do something more
or less sophisticated in Turtle or tkinter or whatever, the code will work if
it just writes out "print" statements to the screen.
